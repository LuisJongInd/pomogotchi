# Pomogotchi

Pomogotchi is a small STM32-based device aimed to be a company while completing daily tasks. Inspired by the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), Pomogotchi sets custumizable alarms and gets track of your weekly completed tasks in order to keep you motivated. 

Designed wih a [bare-metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine) approach and using a [2.13inch e-paper display](https://www.waveshare.com/product/displays/e-paper/2.13inch-e-paper-hat-plus.htm), the Pomogotchi's battery is intended to last long.
